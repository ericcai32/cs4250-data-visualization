# CS4250 Data Visualization
This repository contains projects I completed during the CS4250 Data Visualization class at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. I took this class in the spring of 2024. It was taught by Dr. Larry Hodges, Chair of Computer Science at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and Emeritus Director and Professor in the School of Computing at Clemson University. A course description is included below.

Data visualization is an important subdomain of Data Science where you translate data into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make the data easier for the human brain to determine important characteristics and patterns. This course will provide you with the knowledge and practical skills necessary to develop a strong foundation for data visualization, and to design and develop advanced applications for visual data analysis. In particular, you will learn how to perform data visualization and analysis using data visualization libraries written for the Python programming language including Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas.
